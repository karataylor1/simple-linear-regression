# Overview

This software is a Simple Linear Regression Model, that uses data csv to compare Infections Reported and Infections Predicted for MRSI blood infections. It shows a graph with a linear regression line and data points, the linear regression equation, and other information. 

This project has helped me learn about R, linear regression, and how to cry when you accidently delete your whole project.

# Future Work

- Improving the look of the graph.
- Making the printed information displayed neater.
- Making the code more effecient and readable.
